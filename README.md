# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm RenÃ§ber

---

I'm a Computer Programming student. For me, coding isn't just a profession â€” it's a way to turn my thoughts into something real.

I truly enjoy developing games using Unreal Engine and C++. At the moment, I'm working on a racing game. I'm also exploring backend topics like REST APIs, microservice architecture, Docker, and more to deepen my skills.

This repo is a simple space to document what I'm learning, building, and experiencing along the way.  
I'm still learning a lot, but I try to make what I learn meaningful whenever I can.

I don't see software as something purely technical â€” I also see it as a tool to encourage thought and awareness.  
I'm starting with small projects, but I aim to create things that can reach and resonate with more people over time.

When I write code, I often ask myself:  
_"What is this line really serving?"_

Things may not be perfect yet, but I'm leaving my own trace on this journey. ðŸŒ±
